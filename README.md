Create a Texas Hold’em poker hands validation rule engine in c# using unity3D 2018.4 LTS or
higher (No beta or alpha)
You will be creating a rule engine that can determine the rank of a poker hand. This rule engine
needs to be able to accept an input of multiple hands and output a list that ranks the hands.
The user needs to be able to select the hands he wants to compare with each other and visually
show the outcome of how they would end up against each other.
Attached to this document is a zip file that contains all the cards required to play Texas Hold’em
poker. The cards are required to be used but the rest of the UI will only be reviewed on some
usability.
The application’s target audience is going to use this on a mobile android phone, you will
deliver a unity project git repository with a final APK build in this. The project should be easy to
review, build, run and validate for another developer. You need to take into consideration that
this project needs to be maintained for the next 5 years and will be updated every 4 weeks.
